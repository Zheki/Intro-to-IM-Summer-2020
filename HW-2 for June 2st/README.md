## Description
By using a 'for' loop in processing, I generated a two dimensional array which acts like a gradient background with the colors green and blue.
With the use of the 'if' conditional in the draw() loop, the program generates randomly colored circles on random coordinates on the canvas.
However, please note that the circles are all the same size. This could be easly changed, by making the arc radius a randomized variable, however I thought that it looked better this way.

## Difficulties
During the writing of this code, I did not face many difficulties. One particular thing that was causing trouble in the software was the interaction between
a the 'for' and 'while' loops, and the draw() loop. By watching [tutorials such as this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8s-7beNP1c), the solution became much clearer.
