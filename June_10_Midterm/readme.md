## Midterm project

This is the final version of the space shooter game. The objective of this game is to kill all of the on-screen enemies by shooting them with a laser bullet.
There are 12 alien enemies which are firing at random rates. Make sure to dodge the bullets, since you only have 3 lives. Each enemy needs to be shot once to be killed.
If you lose the 3 lives, the game instantly stops, and you are required to run it again in order to play.
If you win the game by killing all of the enemies, your reward is listening to the awesome background music for as long as you wish.
#### How to play:
Use the A and D buttons to move left and right.
Use the W button to shoot at the enemies.
Survive and kill them all.
Have fun! :)

### Explanation:
The code is written using OOP. There is a class for the player, enemies, and bullets. The functionality of the code is described in detail with comments
in the code itself. The player and the enemies are displayed using an appropriate image, as well as the background, which currently remains static. 
The bullets are primitive 2D circles which are collored blue for the player and red for the enemies. Text in the upper right corner of the screen shows the player's
lives at all times. Background music is constantly playing in a loop in the background. Player's shots are accompanied by a laser sound effect.

### Difficulties:
