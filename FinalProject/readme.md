## Final Project concept

### Idea
For my final project I am planning to build an autonomous robot. I am hopeful that I will be able to use as much different components from the kit as possible, however, due to the current circuimstances, and limited availability of tools and materals, it is possible that I do not completely achieve this.


### Components
Redboard
Breadboard
Jumper wires
Both DC motors
Both wheels
RGB LED
Red, Blue, Green, or Yellow LED
Distance measuring sensor
Switch
Photoresistor
Push buttons
Battery holder
Servo motor
Thermal sensor(possibly)
LCD screen(possibly)

### Two possibilities
Depending on the availability of jumper wires, I will either construct an autonomous rover with a rotating radar as an awareness mechanism, or a robot that collects and disposes objects, or material. The main difference between these two robots is the useage of the DC motors. The rover will use them as they are supposed to be used, as motors for moving the robot with the wheels. The other option will use them to controll linear movement (similar to stepper motors with belts). I have yet to experiment and determine if the second option is possible.
The project will be controlled by an arduino. Processing will be used as a vizualization interface, for example, vizualizing what the robot would see through the radar, or testing functionalities of the different components using a GUI.
